Ah (Back-back-backstabber)
Ah (Back-back-backstabber)
Ah (Back-back-backstabber)

Bored, stoned, sittin' in your basement
All alone, 'cause your little conversation's got around
And lookie what we all found out (Lookie what we found)
Lookie here, we all found out that you have got a set of loose lips
Twisting stories, all because you're jealous
Now I know exactly what you're all about (What you're all about)
This is what you're all about

Girl, you're such a backstabber (Stabber)
You're such a backstabber
Oh, girl, you're such a shit-talker
And everybody knows it, and everybody knows it
Girl (Girl), you're such a backstabber (Stabber)
You're such a backstabber
Run your mouth more than anyone I've ever known
And everybody knows it, and everybody knows it

Back-back-backstabber
(Talk, talk, talk)
(Talk, talk, talk)
(Talk, talk)

I'm sick and tired
Of hearing all about my life
From other people with all of your lies
Wrapped up so tight
So maybe you should shut your mouth (Shut your mouth)
You never shut your mouth
Honestly, I think it's kinda funny
That you waste your breath talkin' about me
Got me feelin' kinda special (Really)
This is what you're all about

Girl, you're such a backstabber (Stabber)
You're such a backstabber
Oh, girl, you're such a shit-talker
And everybody knows it, and everybody knows it
Girl (Girl), you're such a backstabber (Stabber)
You're such a backstabber
Run your mouth more than anyone I've ever known
And everybody knows it, and everybody knows it

Katie's to my left, rippin' my style
Damn, Jeanie, why you gotta tell the secrets 'bout my sex life?
All I ever did was drive your broke ass around
Pick you up, take you out, when your car broke down

Ah (Back-back-backstabber)
Ah (Stabber, stabber)
Ah (Back-back-backstabber)

Girl, you're such a backstabber (Stabber)
You're such a backstabber
Oh, girl (Oh, girl), you're such a shit-talker
And everybody knows it, and everybody knows it
Girl (Oh, girl), you're such a backstabber (Stabber)
(Taking and twisting and telling, so manipulating)
Run your mouth more than anyone I've ever known
And everybody knows it, and everybody knows it

Talk, talk, talk (Back-back-backstabber)
(Taking and twisting and telling, so manipulating)
Oh, girl, talk, talk
You're lookin' like a lunatic
And everybody knows it, and everybody knows it
Everybody knows (Back-back-backstabber)
Yeah, you're lookin' like a lunatic
And everybody knows (Back-back-backstabber)
Yeah, everybody knows (Back-back-backstabber)
