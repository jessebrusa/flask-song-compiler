When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face 
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space 
On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And there, the world below can't bother me


Let me tell you now, when I come home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet 
I get away from the hustlin' crowds
And all that rat race noise down in the street 
On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Let's go up on the roof 




At night, the stars put on a show for free
And, darling, you can share it all with me
I keep-a tellin' you-a
Right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble-proof 
And if this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two up on the roof 

Up on the roof 
Oh, come on, baby 
Oh, come on, honey 
Everything is all right
