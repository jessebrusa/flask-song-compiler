From my youngest years
'Til this moment here
I've never seen
Such a lovely queen

From the skies above
To the deepest love
I've never felt
Crazy like this before 

[Chorus:]
Paint my love
You should paint my love
It's the picture of a thousand sunsets
It's the freedom of a thousand doves
Baby, you should paint my love

Been around the world
Then I met you, girl
It's like coming home
To a place I've known 

[Chorus:]
Paint my love
You should paint my love
It's the picture of a thousand sunsets
It's the freedom of a thousand doves
Baby, you should paint my love

Since you came into my life 
The days before all fade to black and white
Since you came into my life 
Everything has changed

[Chorus:]
Paint my love
You should paint my love
It's the picture of a thousand sunsets
It's the freedom of a thousand doves
Baby, you should paint my love

[Chorus:]
Paint my love
You should paint my love
It's the picture of a thousand sunsets
It's the freedom of a thousand doves
Baby, you should paint my love
