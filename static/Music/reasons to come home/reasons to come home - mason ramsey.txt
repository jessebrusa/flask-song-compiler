It's a map dot
Just a little postcard town
No one ever stops
No one ever comes around
Oh but here I am
Driving right down Main Street
If you don't understand
You probably don't know nothing 'bout me

The things that mean the most, you see
Live in a little house
Yeah the folks who raised a man like me
Are getting older now
And I don't see myself coming back this way
Once the ones I love are gone
'Cause I've run out of reasons to come home

At the dairy bar
A mental of the fries and shake
But I never come this far
'Cause it's about the people not the place
Sure there's a sunset you can't forget
That drops on top of the river
I won't come here when they ain't here
I just have to remember

The things that mean the most, you see
Live in a little house
Yeah the folks who raised a man like me
Are getting older now
And I don't see myself coming back this way
Once the ones I love are gone
'Cause I've run out of reasons to come home

Yeah there's gonna be a day
That I'll be thinking that I miss this place
But I won't really miss this place

I'll miss the things that mean the most, you see
Living in that little house
Yeah the folks who raised the man like me
Are getting older now
And I don't see myself coming back this way
Once the ones I love are gone
'Cause I've run out of reasons to come home
And I've run out of reasons to come home
