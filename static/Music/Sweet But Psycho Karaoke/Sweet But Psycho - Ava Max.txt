Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind."
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind."

She'll make you curse, but she a blessing
She'll rip your shirt within a second
You'll be coming back, back for seconds
With your plate, you just can't help it

No, no
You'll play along
Let her lead you on
You'll be sayin', "No, no."
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes,"
'Cause she messin' with your head

Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind."
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind."

Grab a cop gun. Kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, "Run, don't walk away."
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind."

See, someone said, "Don't drink her potions
She'll kiss your neck with no emotions
When she's mean, you know you love it
She tastes so sweet. Don't sugarcoat it."

No, no
You'll play along,
Let her lead you on
You'll be saying, "No (no, no, no), no (no)."
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes."
'Cause she messin' with your head

Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind."

You're just like me, you're out your mind
I know it's strange. We're both the crazy kind
You're tellin' me that I'm insane
Boy, don't pretend that you don't love the pain

Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind."
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
