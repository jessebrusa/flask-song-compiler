There's some scars in my heart from this knife in my back and you
So I'mma try to ease the pain in my brain with 90 proof
"Fuck you"

You left the whole town talking
Like I'm the one walking
But they don't know the truth

I get off at 8
My day ain't been great
But I tell you what I'm gonna do

I'mma take some cheap shots
Just plastic cup sipping straight
Whiskey no mixin
Don't need rocks
Just send em on over
Ain't leaving here sober
There's a sweet spot

Of just enough drank where I ain't gotta think
So let the drip drop
Cuz I ain't gunna stop

I'mma take some cheap shots
I'mma take some cheap shots

I caught a slick left hook
When I made my way to the door

Hell, it caught me by surprise
Made my drank spill and hit the floor
"Oh Lord"
And then I turn around to your new found crowd
With my eye turning black and blue
He was standing there laughing
I new it had to happen
Cuz he's a bitch just like you

And I can take a cheap shot
So I drug him out back
Started whoopin his ass
In the parking lot
The gravel kept flying
And I heard your ass crying
Yellin' please stop
But I just kept going
Cell phone cameras rollin
Till his ass was rocked
Hell the might as well call the cops
Cuz I'm take some cheap shots
I'm take some cheap shots

Well My side chick came today to pay my bail
And she was there the whole time you put my heart through hell

And we gone take some cheap shots
Plastic cup sippin'
Straight whiskey no mixin
Don't need rocks
Just send em on over
Ain't leaving here sober
There's a sweet spot
Of just enough drank
And the way she says my name
Ain't she hot
She's everything that you not

And she likes cheap shots
Oh, yeah
She likes cheap shots
