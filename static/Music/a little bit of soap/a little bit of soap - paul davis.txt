A little bit of soap
Will wash away your lipstick on my face
But a little bit of soap
Will never never never ever erase
The pain in my heart, and my eyes
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap
Will never wash away my tears

Mmm, a little bit of soap
Will wash away your powder from my chin
A little bit of soap
Will never never never ever begin
To take away the hurt that I feel
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap
Will never wash away my tears

Now have you heard when love begins to die
It leaves someone to cry night and day?
Just like a bird, you left your robin's nest
And just like all the rest, you flew away

Mmm, a little bit of soap
Will take away your perfume eventually
But a little bit of soap
Will never take away the memory
Of your name in the night
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap
Will never wash away my tears

I'll never lose the memory
Of your name in the night
That I call through the lonely years
A little bit of soap
Will never wash away my tears
Mmm, a little bit of soap
Will never wash away my tears
...
Mmm, it's gonna never, never, never
Uh-huh, wash away my tears
