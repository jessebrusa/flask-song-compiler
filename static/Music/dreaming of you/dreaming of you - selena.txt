Late at night when all the world is sleeping
I stay up and think of you
And I wish on a star that somewhere you are
Thinking of me too

'Cause I'm dreaming of you tonight
'Til tomorrow I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room dreaming about you and me

Wonder if you ever see me
And I wonder if you know I'm there
Am I there? Am I?
If you looked in my eyes
Would you see what's inside
Would you even care?

I just wanna hold you close
But so far all I have are dreams of you
So I wait for the day, wait for the day
And the courage to say
How much I love you
Yes I do!

I'll be dreaming of you tonight
'Til tomorrow I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room dreaming about you and me

Coraz칩n
I can't stop dreaming of you
No puedo dejar de pensar en ti
I can't stop dreaming
C칩mo te necesito
I can't stop dreaming of you
Mi amor, c칩mo te extra침o

Late at night when all the world is sleeping
I stay up and think of you
And I still can't believe
That you came up to me
And said, "I love you."
I love you too!

Now I'm dreaming with you tonight
'Til tomorrow and for all of my life
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room dreaming with you endlessly

With you tonight
'Til tomorrow
'Til tomorrow I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room
I'll be dreaming of you tonight endlessly
And I'll be holding you tight
'Til tomorrow dreaming endlessly
With you tonight
Endlessly endlessly dreaming
