It was the year 2005, Youtube had just begun
So we made a video, just for fun
We lip synced the Pokemon theme, we thought it was alright
But randomly, some dick removed it, claiming copyright

POKEMON, YOU DON'T KNOW THE LAW
Why can't you see, it was a parody
POKEMON
Oh, you used to be cool, 'til you turned into a tool

POKEMON, YOU CAN GO TO HELL
It got tons of views, your legal team's full of n00bs
Mess with me and I'll teach you, 
POKEMON!

TRY TO SUE US NOW!
Try to sue us now!

Had 24 million views
The most viewed on YouTube's space
But the legal douches flagged it
Robbed our rightful place

Let's kick their ass, the time is right
There's no better team
Arm-in-arm we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream!

POKEMON, YOU DON'T KNOW THE LAW
Why can't you see, it was a parody
POKEMON
Oh, you used to be cool, 'til you turned into a tool

POKEMON, YOU CAN GO TO HELL
It got tons of views, your legal team's full of n00bs
Mess with me and I'll teach you,
POKEMON!

TRY TO SUE US NOW!
Try to sue us now!

Try to sue us now...

POKEMON, YOU DON'T KNOW THE LAW
Why can't you see, it was a parody
POKEMON
Ooooh, you used to be cool, til you turned into a tool

POKEMON, YOU CAN GO TO HELL
It got tons of views, your legal team's full of noobs
Mess with me and I'll teach you
POKEMON!

TRY TO SUE US NOW!
POKEMON!
