Sunrise, sunrise
Looks like mornin' in your eyes
But the clock's held 9:15 for hours

Sunrise, sunrise
Couldn't tempt us if it tried
'Cause the afternoon's already come and gone

And I said, "Ooh, ooh, ooh." to you.

Surprise, surprise
Couldn't find it in your eyes
But I'm sure it's written all over my face

Surprise, surprise
Never something I could hide
When I see we made it through another day

And I said, "Ooh, ooh, ooh." to you.

And now the night
Will throw its cover down
On me again.

Ooh, and if I'm right,
It's the only way
To bring me back.

"Ooh, ooh, ooh" to you.
"Ooh, ooh, ooh" to you.
