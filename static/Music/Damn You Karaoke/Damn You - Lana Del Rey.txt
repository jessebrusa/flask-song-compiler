I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now, you fall asleep with another
Damn you

'Member how we used to escape for the summer?
Fireworks and sparklers would light up the black skies
We'd hold on tight for our lives to each other
Hello, hello, where did you go?

We were two kids living life on the run
Like the American dream, baby
Nothing to lose and we'd get messed up for fun
We went too fast, too young

But I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now, you fall asleep with another
Damn you
Damn you

Flowers in my hair, and your breath smelled like whiskey
Promise anywhere that I go, take you with me
Dancing on your feet, like a child, to the radio
Hello, hello, where did you go?

We were two kids living life on the run
Of the American dream, baby
Nothing to lose and we'd get messed up for fun
We went too fast, too young

But I won't cry my self to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now, you fall asleep with another
Damn you
Damn you
Damn you
Damn you

Every once in a lifetime
Dreams can come true
Now and then, when the stars shine
You meet somebody like you

And I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
I pray your life is sweet, you fucker
Damn you
Oh, oh, damn you
Damn you
