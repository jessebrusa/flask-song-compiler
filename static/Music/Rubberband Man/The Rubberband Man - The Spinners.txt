Hand me down my walkin' cane, hand me down my hat
Hurry now and don't be late 'cause we ain't got time to chat
You and me, we're goin' out to catch the latest sounds
Guaranteed to blow your mind so high, you won't come down, no

Hey, you all prepare yourself for the Rubberband Man
You've never heard a sound like the Rubberband Man
You're bound to lose control when the Rubberband starts to jam

Oh Lord, this dude is outta sight
Everything he does seems to come out right

Once I went to hear them play at a club outside of town
I was so surprised, I was hypnotized by the sound this cats put down
When I saw this short fat guy stretch a band between his toes
Hey, I laughed so hard 'cause the man got down
When he finally reached his goal

Hey, you all prepare yourself for the Rubberband Man
You've never heard a sound like the Rubberband Man
You're bound to lose control when the Rubberband starts to jam

Got that rubber band up on his toes
And then he wriggled it up all around his nose

Guaranteed to blow your mind
Playin' all that music yet keepin' time
Where in the world did he learn that, oh Lord
Oh, help him get away

Hey, y'all prepare yourself for the Rubberband Man
You've never heard a sound like the Rubberband Man
You're bound to lose control when the Rubberband starts to jam

Rubberband Man, Rubberband Man
How much of this stuff do he think we can stand?
So much rhythm, grace and debonair for one man, Lord
And then he had the nerve to wiggle his left toe
To his knee got the feelin' in his head, y'all, ah, come on, baby

Hey, you all prepare yourself for the Rubberband Man
You've never heard a sound like the Rubberband Man
You're bound to lose control when the Rubberband starts to jam

Rubberband Man starts to jam
Movin' up and down across the land
Got people all in his ways
Everything about him seems outta place

Just move it, just move it, just move, move, move it, just
Rubberband, Rubberband Man
Just move it, just move it, just move, move, move it, just
Rubberband, Rubberband Man
Get down, oh, get down, lover
