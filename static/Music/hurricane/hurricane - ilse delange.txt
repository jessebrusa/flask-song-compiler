Tick tack on the wall, screaming out a silent call
Could this be another warming
Higher pressure's got me falling
Into worlds I've never seen
Seemed so far away from me
I always ran away from the storm

Maybe I haven't cried enough tears
Maybe I haven't laughed out loud
Maybe I have been stuck in amber
Just a part of the crowd

Nothing's wrong, nothing's changed
Here in the eye of the hurricane
Strong enough to take the pain
Far from the eye of the hurricane

Tick tack on the wall, could this be my wake up call
Hiding underneath the sheets
I wait for life to come to me
Think it's time I break these patterns
Systematic comes a habit
Am I strong enough to believe

Maybe I haven't cried enough tears
Maybe I haven't laughed out loud
Maybe I have been stuck in amber
Just a part of the crowd

Nothing's wrong, nothing's changed
Here in the eye of the hurricane
Strong enough to take the pain
Far from the eye of the hurricane

Carry on, carry on, just to get along

Nothing's wrong, nothing's changed
Nothing's wrong, nothing's changed
Here in the eye of the hurricane
Strong enough to take the pain
Far from the eye of the hurricane
